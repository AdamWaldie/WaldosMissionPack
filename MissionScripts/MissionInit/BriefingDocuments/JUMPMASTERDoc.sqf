<font color='#addde6'>Organize Stick:</font><br/><br/>
Usually the stick will consist of 2 squads plus platoon, company or other staff.  The stick can consist of no more than 24 troopers not including the jumpmaster.  The stick should be organized as follows:<br/><br/>

1.	The jump order of squads is determined by the company commander or OIC.<br/><br/>

2.	The stick should be organized by squad in squad file. Alpha team, SL, Bravo team. Buddy teams should always be together in the stick.  Command elements can be placed in the center of the stick and should be assigned a jump buddy.<br/><br/>

3.	Once ordered in file, the jumpmaster will walk down the file, assigning a number to each trooper.  The first trooper in the stick is numbered 1.  Caution the troopers to remember their number and place in the stick.<br/><br/>

<font color='#addde6'>Brief the Stick:</font><br/><br/>
Conduct the briefing as follows:<br/><br/>

1.	Assign the jump frequency. SR 100 by default. Increment up by 1 for each subsequent stick.<br/><br/>

2.	On the map, identify the drop zone and the route onto it.  Provide the grid reference of the drop zone rally point.<br/><br/>

3.	Confirm the timings, order of operations and basic jump commands.<br/><br/>

4.	Landing plan including the order of aircraft, i.e. will they be in the first aircraft, second or third etc. (Or in the case of multiple passes of a single aircraft, the order they will be going in)<br/><br/>

5.	Procedure for requesting medical aid on the DZ.  Contact SL on squad SR and request CLS or platoon medic.<br/><br/>

6.	Take questions.
