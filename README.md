# WaldosMissionPack
A package of mission scripts for new mission makers.

**If you find this mission pack inside a mission, please do not utilise it. Mission Makers like to customise the pack. Instead download the original from github: https://github.com/AdamWaldie/WaldosMissionPack/releases/latest**

This project was created originally for the mission makers of the Rooster Teeth Gaming Discord, with the intent to provide them with the easiest possible method 
to utilise critical systems of arma 3.

To this end, the majority of QOL & critical scripts can be utilised via the init.sqf, initServer.sqf, initPlayerlocal.sqf & description.ext files.

Functions are defined in WaldoFunctions.sqf in MissionScripts Folder.

The Function is always: Waldo_fnc_X

Where X is replaced by the class furthest to the right of the screen in the file.


Each function specifically referances a file, so that you may locate and read up on how the function works, should you need to call it yourself.


Unless you are wanting to use specific features such as: creating starter crates, autolimited arsenals or Mobile Headquarters systems amoung other scripts, you need not venture further than the root mission directory.

For those seeking knowledge or greater control, each file is fully documented on its usage, its parameters and its purpose.

# Required Steps To Enable Scripts
1. Copy the contents of the WMP_VERSION folder into your user directory (This will provide you with an exemplar mission on Altis - utilising RHS.
2. Copy everything bar the mission.sqm from that folder into your mission
3. Ensure that the mission.sqm is unbinarized (attributes --> General --> under Misc --> uncheck the "binarize the scenario file" box)
4. Fill out the relevant information in the description.ext
5. IF YOU ARE USING ACE 3:
   - Disable ACE 3 Respawn in server & mission addon settings.
6. IF YOU ARE USING ACRE2:
   - Player Groups MUST be given a Callsign in Eden & have their Callsign & radio frequiencies assigned in missionParameters.sqf.
7. Waldo's AI tweaks can be set via the missionParameters.sqf file.

# Other Information
- All files are provided with description on their utilisation, their parameters and how you can use them.
- missionParameters.sqf is heavily documented and should be worth a look.
- initPlayerLocal.sqf utilises CBA eventhandlers to provide respawn loadout saving/loading. You can choose whether to respawn with starting equipment, or what they died with in that file.
- initServer.sqf allows the definition of custom logistics crates & the specification of the side of players for startercrates and logistics crate contents.
