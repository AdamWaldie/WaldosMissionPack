Hey reader!

if you are, well, reading this you are probably interested in making missions, especially with ACRE 2 as the radio mod.

This mission serves to provide you with all the mission scripts required, and how to modify them for your own uses as well as provide ingame scripting knowledge and snippets for use in your own missions.

Good luck, and feel free to ask if you are stuck!

- Waldo


NOTES:

All the scripts contain the relevant "calls" for implementation. Ask Waldo if you have questions!

TAKE A LOOK AT:
missionparameters.sqf to setup whats required for ACRE2 & AI settings
initPlayerLocal.sqf for respawn scripting.


REQUIRED THINGS FOR THIS TO WORK:
DISABLE ACE 3 RESPAWN IN ADDON OPTIONS FOR SERVER & MISSION
Groups MUST be given a Callsign in Eden & have their Callsign & radio frequiencies assigned in missionParameters.sqf.
Mission Title must be set in missionParameters.sqf for title screen information to work.
